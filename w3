<p title="This is the title section where you can write something to hover over the paragraph.> Paragraph example. Hyperlinks in html use an a tag. <a href="LINK"> Word/s to be linked</a> 
When using quotes for things like links you can use single or double quotes, however, if there is a quote inside the quote use the opposite to what the quote uses as either double or single quotes to make the code understandable to the machine rendering it.</p>

<p style="font-family:courier"> Another paragraph, this time with the courier font. Image code: <img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="50" height="100"> IMAGE shrinks or pulls to fit the size allocated.</p>

<br> <p> Breaks are different from paragraphs. A break was used before this paragraph. hr code creates a horizontal line to act as a breaker. Hr code and br codes do not require closes.
