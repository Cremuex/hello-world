W3 HTML grab codes - Try to use lower case in codes.

<!doctype hmtl> (Indicates the use of html5)
<html lang="en-US">
<head>
<title>Title code does not appear on page. ONLY THOSE IN THE BODY BRACKETS ARE VISIBLE.</title>
</head>

<Body style="background-color:lavender">

<p><a href="#S2">Jump to Section 2</a></p>
<h1 style="text-align:center"> Heading size 1 Largest at centre align.</h1>
<h2> Heading size 2</h2>
<h3> Heading size 3</h3>
<h4> Heading size 4</h4>
<h5> Heading size 5</h5>
<h6> Heading Size 6 Smallest</h6>

<p title="This is the title section where you can write something to hover over the paragraph.> Paragraph example. Hyperlinks in html use an a tag. <a href="LINK"> Word/s to be linked</a> 
When using quotes for things like links you can use single or double quotes, however, if there is a quote inside the quote use the opposite to what the quote uses as either double or single quotes to make the code understandable to the machine rendering it.</p>

<p style="font-family:courier"> Another paragraph, this time with the courier font. Image code: <img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="50" height="100"> IMAGE shrinks or pulls to fit the size allocated.
ALWAYS specify the size of the picture otherwise the page will flicker white. The image code does not have a close. <img src="wrongname.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:128px;height:128px;"> The ALT tag shows is the image is missing, has a slow connection, coding error or is being used by a blind person using a page reader. I intend to use this as much as possible. Alt is good for the blind, visually impaired or learning disabled. 
Style tags are better then width and height because it conforms universally throughout the site and also prevents automatic and unwanted image stretch.</p>
Images can be stored in folders as well as the page, images need to be linked in if they are from other folders or directories. <img src="/images/html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:128px;height:128px;"> Even images from other sites:  <img src="http://www.w3schools.com/images/w3schools_green.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com"> 

<p>Image maps can be useful for things like world explore section. <img src="planets.gif" alt="Planets" usemap="#planetmap" style="width:145px;height:126px;">

<map name="planetmap">
  <area shape="rect" coords="0,0,82,126" alt="Sun" href="sun.htm">
  <area shape="circle" coords="90,58,3" alt="Mercury" href="mercur.htm">
  <area shape="circle" coords="124,58,8" alt="Venus" href="venus.htm">
</map>
</p>

<p> Breaks are different from paragraphs. 
<br>A break was used before this sentence. hr code creates a horizontal line to act as a breaker. Hr code and br codes do not require closes.

<h2 style="color:pink">I am Pink</h2>
<h2 style="color:purple">I am Purple, these preset colours do not need hex code.</h2> </p>
<hr>

<pre>
Pre means preformatted text and it keeps details about         spacing        and 
line breaks.
</pre>
